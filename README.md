So How Did I Code My Assignment ?

Before i touched the comptuter i got a pen and a piece of paper .I made a rough design of what i wanted my spaceship to look like and i wrote down what i wanted it to do 
(ie What Functionality it would have). I started by coding the outline of the inside of my ship . Once that was done i thought that i should make the planets and stars outside 
the ships windows.Intially i had the stars going from left the right on the screen but then thought to myself in space the stars would be coming straight toward the ship.So i 
used the translate fuction to make it look like the ship is surrounded by stars in every direction so that when the player moved forward they travel through the stars.

Next i added fuctionality to my ship, I made a throttle which when pulled allows the ship to go into warp mode and travel at supersonic speed. 
I made a fuel and Oxygen gauge that moves depending on if the ship accelerates or decerlates (or enters warp mode).
i made button which allow the user to turn on the radio and contact the Spacestation.
I made the radar that allowed used to click a planet and look at that planets information.
I also made buttons which allowed the user to enter a 3rd person mode and also make the ship turn invisable

An aspect i am  proud is ,the screen that display the planet information. Im quite content with this aspect because im loading in data which i have collected myself and 
im using it to diplay informtion to the user.I also enjoyed learning about new planets and maybe i can teach the user something new too.

Another aspect im very proud about is the Invisable Cloak and 3rd Person modes.Im happy with these buttons/modes because they allow the user to completely change the 
the look of the sketch.In also enables me to show off what ive created.In Invisable mode the user gets to see the stars and planets ive created.While in 3rd person mode 
they can see the ship ive creted.
